## Task For EBTECH TECHNOLOGIES company

A Flutter app that fetches a list of products from a public API and 
allows users to add products to a shopping cart. 

I used a strong Clean Architecture which can handle big projects .

It consists of several layers that allow me to easily control the flow of data and handle all errors and exceptions. 

Most importantly, the speed of maintenance and addition.

I used many useful offices that allow to create this structure such as:


shared_preferences: ^2.5.3
	To store and retrieve data on the device's internal memory safely.

dio: ^5.8.0+1
	for fetch data and handle it smoothly

get_it: ^8.0.3
	To apply the concept of Dependency injection and OOP

internet_connection_checker: ^3.0.1
	For check internet connection
